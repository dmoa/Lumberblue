    <p>I made the grass tile and tiled across in photoshop, then I made a stone tile and made a path with it</p>
    <p>I also added some small blades of grass overlapping with the stone tile, as well as some light green on the edges</p>
    <p>I have never really used this image in any games, seems like it would be a cool loading screen for some sort of foresty game</p>
